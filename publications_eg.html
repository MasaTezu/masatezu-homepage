                        1-out-of-n oblivious signature by Chen (ESORIC 1994) is a protocol between the user and the signer. In this scheme, the user makes a list of n messages and chooses the message that the user wants to obtain a signature from the list. The user interacts with the signer by providing this message list and obtains the signature for only the chosen message without letting the signer identify which messages the user chooses. Tso et al. (ISPEC 2008) presented a formal treatment of 1- out-of-n oblivious signatures. They defined unforgeability and ambiguity for 1-out-of-n oblivious signatures as a security requirement.<br>
                        In this work, first, we revisit the unforgeability security definition by Tso et al. and point out that their security definition has problems. We address these problem by modifying their security model and redefining unforgeable security. Second, we improve the generic construction of a 1- out-of-n oblivious signature scheme by Zhou et al. (IEICE Trans 2022). We reduce the communication cost by modifying their scheme with a Merkle tree. Then we prove the security of our modified scheme.

                        The learning with errors (LWE) problem is one of the fundamental problems in cryptography and it has many applications in post-quantum cryptography. There are two variants of the problem, the decisional-LWE problem, and the search-LWE problem. LWE search-to-decision reduction shows that the hardness of the search-LWE problem can be reduced to the hardness of the decisional-LWE problem. The efficiency of the reduction can be regarded as the gap in difficulty between the problems.<br>
                        We initiate a study of quantum search-to-decision reduction for the LWE problem and propose a reduction that satisfies sample-preserving. In sample-preserving reduction, it preserves all parameters even the number of instances. Especially, our quantum reduction invokes the distinguisher only 2 times to solve the search-LWE problem, while classical reductions require a polynomial number of invocations. Furthermore, we give a way to amplify the success probability of the reduction algorithm. Our amplified reduction works with fewer LWE samples compared to the classical reduction that has a high success probability. Our reduction algorithm supports a wide class of error distributions and also provides a search-to-decision reduction for the learning parity with noise problem.<br>
                        In the process of constructing the search-to-decision reduction, we give a quantum Goldreich-Levin theorem over Z_{q} where q is prime. In short, this theorem states that, if a hardcore predicate ùëé‚ãÖùë†(mod q) can be predicted with probability distinctly greater than 1/q with respect to a uniformly random a \in Z_{q}^{n}, then it is possible to determine s \in Z_{q}^{n}.

                        Synchronized aggregate signature is a special type of signa ture that all signers have a synchronized time period and allows aggregating signatures which are generated in the same period. This signature has a wide range of applications for systems that have a natural reporting period such as log and sensor data, or blockchain protocol.<br>
                        In CT-RSA 2016, Pointcheval and Sanders proposed the new randomizable signature scheme. Since this signature scheme is based on type-3 pairing, this signature achieves a short signature size and efficient signature verification.<br>
                        In this paper, we design the Pointchcval-Sanders signature-based synchronized aggregate signature scheme and prove its security under the generalized Pointcheval-Sanders assumption in the random oracle model. Our scheme offers the most efficient aggregate signature verification among synchronized aggregate signature schemes based on bilinear groups.

                        Message franking is introduced by Facebook in end-to-end encrypted messaging services. It allows to produce verifiable reports of malicious messages by including cryptographic proofs generated by Facebook. Recently, Grubbs et al. (CRYPTO‚Äô17) proceeded with the formal study of message franking and introduced committing authenticated encryption with associated data (CAEAD) as a core primitive for obtaining message franking.<br>
                        In this work, we aim to enhance the security of message franking and propose forward security for message franking. It guarantees the security associated with the past keys even if the current keys are exposed. Firstly, we propose the notion of key-evolving message franking including addi- tional key update algorithms. Then, we formalize forward security for five security requirements: confidentiality, ciphertext integrity, unforgeability, receiver binding, and sender binding. Finally, we show a construction of forward secure message franking based on CAEAD, forward secure pseudorandom generator, and forward secure message authentication code.

                        Time-lock puzzles allow one to encapsulate a message for a pre-determined amount of time. The message is required to be concealed from any algorithm running in parallel time less than the pre-determined amount of time. In the previous works, the security of time-lock puzzles was formalized in an indistinguishability manner. However, it is unclear whether it directly meets the security requirements of time-lock puzzles. In this work, we define semantic security for time-lock puzzles, which captures the security requirements of the time-lock puzzle more directly. We consider three computational restrictions of an adversary and see how the security relationship changes. At first, in the traditional setting, we observe that it is difficult to prove that the semantic security implies the indistinguishability, same as the opposite implication. Secondly, in a slightly relaxed setting, we show that it is possible to prove that the semantic security implies the indistinguishability. By contrast, we observe that it is difficult to prove the opposite implication. Thirdly, in the more relaxed setting, we show that it is possible to prove that semantic security is equivalent to the indistinguishability. This shows that an indistinguishability meets the security requirements of time-lock puzzles in a certain restriction.

                        Software watermarking enables one to embed some information called ‚Äúmark‚Äù into a program while preserving its functionality, and to read it from the program. As a definition of function preserving, Cohen et al. (STOC 2016) proposed statistical function preserving which requires that the input/output behavior of the marked circuit is identical almost everywhere to that of the original unmarked circuit. They showed how to construct watermarkable cryptographic primitives with statistical function preserving, including pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and public-key encryption from indistinguishability obfuscation. Recently, Goyal et al. (CRYPTO 2019) introduced more relaxed definition of function preserving for watermarkable signature. Watermarkable signature embeds a mark into a signing circuit of digital signature. The relaxed function preserving only requires that the marked signing circuit outputs valid signatures. They provide watermarkable signature with the relaxed function preserving only based on (standard) digital signature.<br>
                        In this work, we introduce an intermediate notion of function preserving for watermarkable signature, which is called computational function preserving. Then, we examine the relationship among our computational function preserving, relaxed function preserving by Goyal et al., and statistical function preserving by Cohen et al. Furthermore, we propose a generic construction of watermarkable signature scheme satisfying computational function preserving based on public key encryption and (standard) digital signature.

                        The Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature scheme in CRYPTO 2004 is a useful building block to construct privacy-preserving schemes such as anonymous credentials, group signatures or ring signatures. However, the security of this signature scheme relies on the interactive assumption called the LRSW assumption. Even if the interactive assumptions are proven in the generic group model or bilinear group model, the concerns about these assumptions arise in a cryptographic community. This fact caused a barrier to the use of cryptographic schemes whose security relies on these assumptions.<br>
                        Recently, Pointcheval and Sanders proposed the modified Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature scheme in CT-RSA 2018. This scheme satisfies the EUF-CMA security under the new q-type assumption called the Modified-q-Strong Diffie-Hellman-2 (q-MSDH-2) assumption. However, the size of a q-type assumptions grows dynamically and this fact leads to inefficiency of schemes.<br>
                        In this work, we revisit the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature-based synchronized aggregate signature scheme in FC 2013. This scheme is one of the most efficient synchronized aggregate signature schemes with bilinear groups. However, the security of this synchronized aggregate scheme was proven under the one-time LRSW assumption in the random oracle model. We give the new security proof for this synchronized aggregate scheme under the 1-MSDH-2 (static) assumption in the random oracle model with little loss of efficiency.

                        A redactable signature scheme allows removing parts of a signed message without invalidating the signature. Currently, the need to prove the validity of digital documents issued by governments and enterprises is increasing. However, when disclosing documents, governments and enterprises must remove privacy information concerning individuals. A redactable signature scheme is useful for such a situation.<br>
                        In this paper, we introduce the new notion of the t-out-of-n redactable signature scheme. This scheme has a signer, n redactors, a combiner, and a verifier. The signer designates n redactors and a combiner in advance and generates a signature of a message M. Each redactor decides parts that he or she wants to remove from the message and generates a piece of redaction information. The combiner collects pieces of redaction information from all redactors, extracts parts of the message that more than t redactors want to remove, and generate a redacted message.<br>
                        We consider the one-time redaction model which allows redacting signatures generated by the signer only once. We formalize the one-time redaction t-out-of-n redactable signature scheme, define security, and give a construction using the pairing based aggregate signature scheme in the random oracle model.

                        Weakened random oracle models (WROMs) are variants of the random oracle model (ROM). The WROMs have the random oracle and the additional oracle which breaks some property of a hash function. Analyzing the security of cryptographic schemes in WROMs, we can specify the property of a hash function on which the security of cryptographic schemes depends.<br>
                        Liskov (SAC‚Äô06) proposed WROMs and later Numayama et al. (PKC‚Äô08) formalized them as CT-ROM, SPT-ROM, and FPT-ROM. In each model, there is the additional oracle to break collision resistance, second preimage resistance, preimage resistance respectively. Tan and Wong (ACISP‚Äô12) proposed the generalized FPT-ROM (GFPT-ROM) which intended to capture the chosen prefix collision attack suggested by Stevens et al. (EUROCRYPT‚Äô07).<br>
                        In this paper, in order to analyze the security of cryptographic schemes more precisely, we formalize GFPT-ROM and propose additional three WROMs which capture the chosen prefix collision attack and its variants. In particular, we focus on signature schemes such as RSA-FDH, its variants, and DSA, in order to understand essential roles of WROMs in their security proofs.

                        Message franking is introduced by Facebook in end-to-end encrypted messaging services. It allows to produce verifiable reports of malicious messages by including cryptographic proofs, called reporting tags, generated by Facebook. Recently, Grubbs et al. (CRYPTO'17) proceeded with the formal study of message franking and introduced committing authenticated encryption with associated data (CAEAD) as a core primitive for obtaining message franking.<br>
                        In this work, we aim to enhance the security of message franking and introduce forward security and updates of reporting tags for message franking. Forward security guarantees the security associated with the past keys even if the current keys are exposed and updates of reporting tags allow for reporting malicious messages after keys are updated. To this end, we firstly propose the notion of key-evolving message franking with updatable reporting tags including additional key and reporting tag update algorithms. Then, we formalize five security requirements: confidentiality, ciphertext integrity, unforgeability, receiver binding, and sender binding. Finally, we show a construction of forward secure message franking with updatable reporting tags based on CAEAD, forward secure pseudorandom generator, and updatable message authentication code.

                        Software watermarking enables one to embed some information called ‚Äúmark‚Äù into a program while preserving its functionality, and to read it from the program. As a definition of function preserving, Cohen et al. (STOC 2016) proposed statistical function preserving which requires that the input/ output behavior of the marked circuit is identical almost everywhere to that of the original unmarked circuit. They showed how to construct watermarkable cryptographic primitives with statistical function preserving, including pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and public-key encryption from indistinguishability obfuscation. Recently, Goyal et al. (CRYPTO 2019) introduced more relaxed definition of function preserving for watermarkable signature. Watermarkable signature embeds a mark into a signing circuit of digital signature. The relaxed function preserving only requires that the marked signing circuit outputs valid signatures. They provide watermarkable signature with the relaxed function preserving only based on (standard) digital signature.<br>
                        In this work, we introduce an intermediate notion of function preserving for watermarkable signature, which is called computational function preserving. Then, we examine the relationship among our computational function preserving, relaxed function preserving by Goyal et al. , and statistical function preserving by Cohen et al. Furthermore, we propose a generic construction of watermarkable signature scheme satisfying computational function preserving based on public key encryption and (standard) digital signature.

                        Redactable signature allows anyone to remove parts of a signed message without invalidating the signature. The need to prove the validity of digital documents issued by governments is increasing. When governments disclose documents, they must remove private information concerning individuals. Redactable signature is useful for such a situation.<br>
                        However, in most redactable signature schemes, to remove parts of the signed message, we need pieces of information for each part we want to remove. If a signed message consists of l elements, the number of elements in an original signature is at least linear in l.<br>
                        As far as we know, in some redactable signature schemes, the number of elements in an original signature is constant, regardless of the number of elements in a message to be signed. However, these constructions have drawbacks in that the use of the random oracle model or generic group model.<br>
                        In this paper, we construct an efficient redactable signature to overcome these drawbacks. Our redactable signature is obtained by combining set-commitment proposed in the recent work by Fuchsbauer et al. (JoC 2019) and digital signatures.
