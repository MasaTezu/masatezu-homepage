                        1-out-of-n oblivious signature by Chen (ESORIC 1994) is a protocol between the user and the signer. In this scheme, the user makes a list of n messages and chooses the message that the user wants to obtain a signature from the list. The user interacts with the signer by providing this message list and obtains the signature for only the chosen message without letting the signer identify which messages the user chooses. Tso et al. (ISPEC 2008) presented a formal treatment of 1- out-of-n oblivious signatures. They defined unforgeability and ambiguity for 1-out-of-n oblivious signatures as a security requirement.<br>
                        In this work, first, we revisit the unforgeability security definition by Tso et al. and point out that their security definition has problems. We address this problem by modifying their security model and redefining unforgeable security. Second, we improve the generic construction of a 1- out-of-n oblivious signature scheme by Zhou et al. (IEICE Trans 2022). We reduce the communication cost by modifying their scheme with a Merkle tree. Then we prove the security of our modified scheme.

                        The learning with errors (LWE) problem is one of the fundamental problems in cryptography and it has many applications in post-quantum cryptography. There are two variants of the problem, the decisional-LWE problem, and the search-LWE problem. LWE search-to-decision reduction shows that the hardness of the search-LWE problem can be reduced to the hardness of the decisional-LWE problem. The efficiency of the reduction can be regarded as the gap in difficulty between the problems.<br>
                        We initiate a study of quantum search-to-decision reduction for the LWE problem and propose a reduction that satisfies sample-preserving. In sample-preserving reduction, it preserves all parameters even the number of instances. Especially, our quantum reduction invokes the distinguisher only 2 times to solve the search-LWE problem, while classical reductions require a polynomial number of invocations. Furthermore, we give a way to amplify the success probability of the reduction algorithm. Our amplified reduction works with fewer LWE samples compared to the classical reduction that has a high success probability. Our reduction algorithm supports a wide class of error distributions and also provides a search-to-decision reduction for the learning parity with noise problem.<br>
                        In the process of constructing the search-to-decision reduction, we give a quantum Goldreich-Levin theorem over Z_{q} where q is prime. In short, this theorem states that, if a hardcore predicate 𝑎⋅𝑠(mod q) can be predicted with probability distinctly greater than 1/q with respect to a uniformly random a \in Z_{q}^{n}, then it is possible to determine s \in Z_{q}^{n}.

                        Synchronized aggregate signature is a special type of signa ture that all signers have a synchronized time period and allows aggregating signatures which are generated in the same period. This signature has a wide range of applications for systems that have a natural reporting period such as log and sensor data, or blockchain protocol.<br>
                        In CT-RSA 2016, Pointcheval and Sanders proposed the new randomizable signature scheme. Since this signature scheme is based on type-3 pairing, this signature achieves a short signature size and efficient signature verification.<br>
                        In this paper, we design the Pointchcval-Sanders signature-based synchronized aggregate signature scheme and prove its security under the generalized Pointcheval-Sanders assumption in the random oracle model. Our scheme offers the most efficient aggregate signature verification among synchronized aggregate signature schemes based on bilinear groups.

                        Message franking is introduced by Facebook in end-to-end encrypted messaging services. It allows to produce verifiable reports of malicious messages by including cryptographic proofs generated by Facebook. Recently, Grubbs et al. (CRYPTO’17) proceeded with the formal study of message franking and introduced committing authenticated encryption with associated data (CAEAD) as a core primitive for obtaining message franking.<br>
                        In this work, we aim to enhance the security of message franking and propose forward security for message franking. It guarantees the security associated with the past keys even if the current keys are exposed. Firstly, we propose the notion of key-evolving message franking including addi- tional key update algorithms. Then, we formalize forward security for five security requirements: confidentiality, ciphertext integrity, unforgeability, receiver binding, and sender binding. Finally, we show a construction of forward secure message franking based on CAEAD, forward secure pseudorandom generator, and forward secure message authentication code.

                        Time-lock puzzles allow one to encapsulate a message for a pre-determined amount of time. The message is required to be concealed from any algorithm running in parallel time less than the pre-determined amount of time. In the previous works, the security of time-lock puzzles was formalized in an indistinguishability manner. However, it is unclear whether it directly meets the security requirements of time-lock puzzles. In this work, we define semantic security for time-lock puzzles, which captures the security requirements of the time-lock puzzle more directly. We consider three computational restrictions of an adversary and see how the security relationship changes. At first, in the traditional setting, we observe that it is difficult to prove that the semantic security implies the indistinguishability, same as the opposite implication. Secondly, in a slightly relaxed setting, we show that it is possible to prove that the semantic security implies the indistinguishability. By contrast, we observe that it is difficult to prove the opposite implication. Thirdly, in the more relaxed setting, we show that it is possible to prove that semantic security is equivalent to the indistinguishability. This shows that an indistinguishability meets the security requirements of time-lock puzzles in a certain restriction.

                        Software watermarking enables one to embed some information called “mark” into a program while preserving its functionality, and to read it from the program. As a definition of function preserving, Cohen et al. (STOC 2016) proposed statistical function preserving which requires that the input/output behavior of the marked circuit is identical almost everywhere to that of the original unmarked circuit. They showed how to construct watermarkable cryptographic primitives with statistical function preserving, including pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and public-key encryption from indistinguishability obfuscation. Recently, Goyal et al. (CRYPTO 2019) introduced more relaxed definition of function preserving for watermarkable signature. Watermarkable signature embeds a mark into a signing circuit of digital signature. The relaxed function preserving only requires that the marked signing circuit outputs valid signatures. They provide watermarkable signature with the relaxed function preserving only based on (standard) digital signature.<br>
                        In this work, we introduce an intermediate notion of function preserving for watermarkable signature, which is called computational function preserving. Then, we examine the relationship among our computational function preserving, relaxed function preserving by Goyal et al., and statistical function preserving by Cohen et al. Furthermore, we propose a generic construction of watermarkable signature scheme satisfying computational function preserving based on public key encryption and (standard) digital signature.

                        The Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature scheme in CRYPTO 2004 is a useful building block to construct privacy-preserving schemes such as anonymous credentials, group signatures or ring signatures. However, the security of this signature scheme relies on the interactive assumption called the LRSW assumption. Even if the interactive assumptions are proven in the generic group model or bilinear group model, the concerns about these assumptions arise in a cryptographic community. This fact caused a barrier to the use of cryptographic schemes whose security relies on these assumptions.<br>
                        Recently, Pointcheval and Sanders proposed the modified Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature scheme in CT-RSA 2018. This scheme satisfies the EUF-CMA security under the new q-type assumption called the Modified-q-Strong Diffie-Hellman-2 (q-MSDH-2) assumption. However, the size of a q-type assumptions grows dynamically and this fact leads to inefficiency of schemes.<br>
                        In this work, we revisit the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature-based synchronized aggregate signature scheme in FC 2013. This scheme is one of the most efficient synchronized aggregate signature schemes with bilinear groups. However, the security of this synchronized aggregate scheme was proven under the one-time LRSW assumption in the random oracle model. We give the new security proof for this synchronized aggregate scheme under the 1-MSDH-2 (static) assumption in the random oracle model with little loss of efficiency.

                        A redactable signature scheme allows removing parts of a signed message without invalidating the signature. Currently, the need to prove the validity of digital documents issued by governments and enterprises is increasing. However, when disclosing documents, governments and enterprises must remove privacy information concerning individuals. A redactable signature scheme is useful for such a situation.<br>
                        In this paper, we introduce the new notion of the t-out-of-n redactable signature scheme. This scheme has a signer, n redactors, a combiner, and a verifier. The signer designates n redactors and a combiner in advance and generates a signature of a message M. Each redactor decides parts that he or she wants to remove from the message and generates a piece of redaction information. The combiner collects pieces of redaction information from all redactors, extracts parts of the message that more than t redactors want to remove, and generate a redacted message.<br>
                        We consider the one-time redaction model which allows redacting signatures generated by the signer only once. We formalize the one-time redaction t-out-of-n redactable signature scheme, define security, and give a construction using the pairing based aggregate signature scheme in the random oracle model.

                        Weakened random oracle models (WROMs) are variants of the random oracle model (ROM). The WROMs have the random oracle and the additional oracle which breaks some property of a hash function. Analyzing the security of cryptographic schemes in WROMs, we can specify the property of a hash function on which the security of cryptographic schemes depends.<br>
                        Liskov (SAC’06) proposed WROMs and later Numayama et al. (PKC’08) formalized them as CT-ROM, SPT-ROM, and FPT-ROM. In each model, there is the additional oracle to break collision resistance, second preimage resistance, preimage resistance respectively. Tan and Wong (ACISP’12) proposed the generalized FPT-ROM (GFPT-ROM) which intended to capture the chosen prefix collision attack suggested by Stevens et al. (EUROCRYPT’07).<br>
                        In this paper, in order to analyze the security of cryptographic schemes more precisely, we formalize GFPT-ROM and propose additional three WROMs which capture the chosen prefix collision attack and its variants. In particular, we focus on signature schemes such as RSA-FDH, its variants, and DSA, in order to understand essential roles of WROMs in their security proofs.

                        Message franking is introduced by Facebook in end-to-end encrypted messaging services. It allows to produce verifiable reports of malicious messages by including cryptographic proofs, called reporting tags, generated by Facebook. Recently, Grubbs et al. (CRYPTO'17) proceeded with the formal study of message franking and introduced committing authenticated encryption with associated data (CAEAD) as a core primitive for obtaining message franking.<br>
                        In this work, we aim to enhance the security of message franking and introduce forward security and updates of reporting tags for message franking. Forward security guarantees the security associated with the past keys even if the current keys are exposed and updates of reporting tags allow for reporting malicious messages after keys are updated. To this end, we firstly propose the notion of key-evolving message franking with updatable reporting tags including additional key and reporting tag update algorithms. Then, we formalize five security requirements: confidentiality, ciphertext integrity, unforgeability, receiver binding, and sender binding. Finally, we show a construction of forward secure message franking with updatable reporting tags based on CAEAD, forward secure pseudorandom generator, and updatable message authentication code.

                        Software watermarking enables one to embed some information called “mark” into a program while preserving its functionality, and to read it from the program. As a definition of function preserving, Cohen et al. (STOC 2016) proposed statistical function preserving which requires that the input/ output behavior of the marked circuit is identical almost everywhere to that of the original unmarked circuit. They showed how to construct watermarkable cryptographic primitives with statistical function preserving, including pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and public-key encryption from indistinguishability obfuscation. Recently, Goyal et al. (CRYPTO 2019) introduced more relaxed definition of function preserving for watermarkable signature. Watermarkable signature embeds a mark into a signing circuit of digital signature. The relaxed function preserving only requires that the marked signing circuit outputs valid signatures. They provide watermarkable signature with the relaxed function preserving only based on (standard) digital signature.<br>
                        In this work, we introduce an intermediate notion of function preserving for watermarkable signature, which is called computational function preserving. Then, we examine the relationship among our computational function preserving, relaxed function preserving by Goyal et al. , and statistical function preserving by Cohen et al. Furthermore, we propose a generic construction of watermarkable signature scheme satisfying computational function preserving based on public key encryption and (standard) digital signature.

                        Redactable signature allows anyone to remove parts of a signed message without invalidating the signature. The need to prove the validity of digital documents issued by governments is increasing. When governments disclose documents, they must remove private information concerning individuals. Redactable signature is useful for such a situation.<br>
                        However, in most redactable signature schemes, to remove parts of the signed message, we need pieces of information for each part we want to remove. If a signed message consists of l elements, the number of elements in an original signature is at least linear in l.<br>
                        As far as we know, in some redactable signature schemes, the number of elements in an original signature is constant, regardless of the number of elements in a message to be signed. However, these constructions have drawbacks in that the use of the random oracle model or generic group model.<br>
                        In this paper, we construct an efficient redactable signature to overcome these drawbacks. Our redactable signature is obtained by combining set-commitment proposed in the recent work by Fuchsbauer et al. (JoC 2019) and digital signatures.

                        The learning parity with noise (LPN) problem has found many cryptographic applications as the hardness assumption. There are two variants of the problem, decisional LPN problem and search LPN problem. It is known that the decisional LPN problem is polynomially equivalent to the search LPN problem. The most recent proposed reduction is the one proposed by Katz and Shin (EUROCRYPT 2006).<br>
                        In this work, we propose a quantum reduction from the search LPN problem to the decisional LPN problem. Our reduction is inspired by the quantum Goldreich-Levin theorem by Adcock and Cleve (STACS 2002). Specifically, we construct a predictor which predicts inner product of a and s, where a is its input and s is the secret string of the LPN problem, using the distinguisher of the decisional LPN problem. In a similar way to the discussion of the quantum Goldreich-Levin theorem, this predicator can be used to construct a solver of the search LPN problem. The efficiency of our reduction is incomparable to the classical one by Katz and Shin. Then, we investigate the conditions under which our reduction works more efficiently than the classical one.

                        LWE問題は量子計算に対しても困難であると信じられ，多くの耐量子暗号技術の礎となっている．LWE問題にはsearch-LWE問題とdecisional-LWE問題がある．LWE問題のsearch-to-decision帰着とは困難性のよく知られたsearch-LWE問題からより応用に適したdecisional-LWE問題への帰着を指す． LWE問題のsearch-to-decision帰着の効率はこの二つの問題の困難性の差とみなすことができる．まず与えられるインスタンス数を含むすべてのパラメータを保存する帰着（sample-preserving帰着）を与える． 次に，この帰着アルゴリズムを用い，より高い成功確率をもつ帰着アルゴリズムを構成する方法を示す． 最後に，効率について従来の古典計算による帰着との比較を行う．

                        Message franking is introduced by Facebook in end-to-end encrypted messaging services. It allows to produce verifiable reports of malicious messages by including cryptographic proofs generated by Facebook. Recently, Grubbs et al. (CRYPTO'17) proceeded with the formal study of message franking and introduced committing authenticated encryption with associated data (CAEAD) as a core primitive for obtaining message franking.
                        In this work, we aim to enhance the security of message franking and propose forward security for message franking.It guarantees the security associated with the past keys even if the current keys are exposed.
                        Firstly, we propose the notion of key-evolving message franking including additional key update algorithms. 
                        Then, we formalize forward security for five security requirements: confidentiality, ciphertext integrity, unforgeability, receiver binding, andsender binding. 
                        Finally, we show a construction of forward secure message franking basedon CAEAD, forward secure pseudorandom generator, and forward secure message authentication code.

                        同期集約署名は同じ期間に異なる署名者により生成された署名をコンパクトな集約署名に圧縮できる技術である．Leeら(FC 2013)は効率のよい同期集約署名方式を提案し，対話型計算仮定を用いた安全性証明を与えた．対話型計算仮定は効率のよい暗号方式の構成を可能にする．しかし，対話型計算仮定の妥当性は疑問視されており，安全性の観点から非対話型計算仮定を用いない安全性証明が望まれる．
                        本発表では対話型計算仮定の背景について説明し，非対話型計算仮定を用いたLeeら(FC 2013)の同期集約署名方式の安全性証明の改良について概要を説明する．

                        タイムロックパズルは定められた計算時間が経過するまでメッセージを秘匿することができるパズルを生成する技術である．今までタイムロックパズルの安全性として識別不可能ベースのものが使われてきたが，それがタイムロックパズルの本来満たすべき安全性要件を直接的に満たすかどうかは不明である．本論文ではタイムロックパズルの安全性要件をより直接的にとらえる安全性（強秘匿性）を定義する．また，これらの安全性の関係を攻撃者の計算能力に着目して整理する．

                        弱められたランダムオラクルモデルとは，ランダムオラクルに暗号学的ハッシュ関数の特定の性質を破るオラクルが追加されたモデルである．弱められたランダムオラクルでの暗号系の安全性解析により，その暗号系の安全性が依存しているハッシュ関数の性質を特定することができる．本発表では，ハッシュ関数 SHA-1の衝突発見に用いられた選択接頭辞攻撃を捉えることができる新たな弱められたランダムオラクルモデルを提案する．また，このモデルを用いた署名方式の安全性の証明手法と解析結果について発表する．

                        弱められたランダムオラクルモデルは，ハッシュ関数の攻撃を捉え暗号方式の安全性を可能にする．最近，Stevenら(CRYPTO '17) は，ハッシュ関数 SHA-1 の衝突を選択接頭辞攻撃とよばれる手法を用いることで発見した．
                        そこで，本研究ではハッシュ関数が用いられている署名方式に対し，接頭辞攻撃が行われたときの安全性についての考察を弱められたランダムオラクルモデルを用いて行う．
